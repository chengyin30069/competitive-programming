# competitive-programming
My templates and setup scripts for competitive programming in cpp on Windows and Linux platforms<br/>
For windows I use vim-plug, and vundle for Linux, so please be aware<br/>
I also included the portable vimrc that could be used in offline contest such as TOI or ICPC<br/>

hope these files could help you setting up your own vim enviornment for competitive programming<br/>
and this is my waifu, Yuubari(夕張) from the game "Azur Lane"
